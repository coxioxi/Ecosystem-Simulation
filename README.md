<h1>Ecosystem Simulation in Python</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A simple Python-based ecosystem simulator, modeling the interactions between fish, bears, and algae within a dynamic environment. The simulation captures basic ecological relationships, such as bears preying on fish and fish feeding on algae, with population changes over time based on defined rules. Designed using object-oriented programming principles and simple data structures to simulate population dynamics, energy transfer, and environmental balance. Useful for educational purposes and experimentation with predator-prey relationships in a simplified ecosystem
